After browsing the CISSP textbook, I decided to pass it. Because I think it is what I want to master, 
and the CISSP certification is a stepping stone for me to become a security consultant.

## What's CISSP
CISSP means Certified Information Systems Security Professional, it is one of the most sought-after and elite certifications in the information security industry. 
Before getting the CISSP exam, we should know the contents it covered. <br>
The CISSP exam covers eight domains from the (ISC)2 Common Body of Knowledge (CBK):<br>
- Security and Risk Management
- Asset Security
- Security Engineering
- Communications and Network Security
- Identity and Access Management
- Security and Assessment Testing
- Security Operations
- Software Development Security

And we should also know the [CISSP exam outline](https://www.isc2.org/-/media/ISC2/Certifications/Exam-Outlines/CISSP-Exam-Outline-121417--Final.ashx), and then we can learn with a clear objective.

## How to pass CISSP
The CISSP textbook is important, we should learn, think deeply and master it. I have found some information to help me learn by myself. For example, [ZhiHu CISSP](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/tangjf10).

Once we decided to pass it, we should make a plan. Everyone's store of knowledge and security experience are diverse, this means difference time length we may spend. 
There are many good documents and videos we can access to. So get them, learn and think, we can pass it. 

Just go for it!
