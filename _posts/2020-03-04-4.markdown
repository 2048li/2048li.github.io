## WHAT IS COBIT
**COBIT**(Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) is a leading framework for the governance and management of enterprise IT. 
Created by the non-profit ISACA, COBIT was built by experts to suit the requirements of both business executives 
and IT professionals. It combines enterprise governance and management techniques, providing principles, practices, models 
and analytical tools to help users consistently increase the value of, and trust in, their IT systems.<br><br>
The COBIT business orientation includes linking business goals with its IT infrastructure 
by providing various maturity models and metrics that measure the achievement while identifying associated business responsibilities 
of IT processes. The main focus of COBIT 4.1 was illustrated with a process-based model subdivided into four specific domains, including:<br>
- Planning & Organization
- Delivering and Support
- Acquiring & Implementation
- Monitoring & Evaluating

All of this is further understood under 34 processes as per the specific line of responsibilities. 
COBIT has a high position in business frameworks and has been recognized under various international standards, 
including ITIL, CMMI, COSO, PRINCE2, TOGAF, PMBOK, TOGAF, and ISO 27000. 
COBIT acts as a guideline integratorâ€”merging all solutions under one umbrella.<br>
